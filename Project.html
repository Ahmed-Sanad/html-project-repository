            <b>Operating system :</b> is a program that manages a computer's hardware.
            It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary
            between the computer user and the computer hardware.
        </p>

        <h2>The operating system's job</h2>
        <p>
            Your computer's operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware
            on the computer. Most of the time, there are several different computer programs
            running at the same time, and they all need to access your
            computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage.
            The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system
            and may also include accounting software for cost allocation
            of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.
            For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation,
            the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,
            although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware
            and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it.
            Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer – from cellular phones
            and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.
