            <b>Linux</b> is a family of open-source operating systems,
            which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world.
            This is different from proprietary software like Windows,
            which can only be modified by the company that owns it.
            The advantages of Linux are that it is free,
            and there are many different distributions—or versions—you can choose from.
        </p>

        <p>
            Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries,
            many of which are provided by the GNU Project.
            Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name,
            but the Free Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance of GNU software.

            The first version of Debian was released on September 15, 1993 and its first stable version was released on June 17, 1996.
            The Debian Stable branch is the most popular edition for personal computers and servers.
            Debian is also the basis for many other distributions, most notably Ubuntu.
            Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel.
            The project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers.
