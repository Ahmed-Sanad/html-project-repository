            <b> Mobile Operating Systems </b>
            An OS is a software interface that is responsible for managing and operating
            hardware units and assisting the user to use those units. For mobile phones,
            OSs have been developed to enable users to use phones in much the same way as personal computers
            were used 1 or 2 decades ago. The most well-known mobile OSs are Android, iOS, Windows phone OS, and Symbian.
            There are some other mobile OSs that are less used (BlackBerry, Samsung, etc.)

            <b> Android Operating System </b>
            Android is an open-source mobile OS developed by Google and launched in 2008.
            Android is a Linux-based OS that uses Linux 2.6 to provide core services such as
            security, memory management, process management, network stack, and a driver model.
            It offers a wide range of libraries that enable the app developers to build different applications.

            <b> Apple iOS </b>
            Apple iOS is a closed-source code mobile phone OS developed by Apple in 2007
            it is used by Apple-only products (iPhone, iPod, and iPad). The iOS architecture is based on three layers
            incorporated with each other. Cocoa touch is a layer that provides some basic infrastructure used by applications.
            The second layer is the media layer, which provides audio services, animation video, image formats,
            and documents in addition to providing two-dimensional (2D) and 3D drawings and audio and video support.
            The third layer is the core OS, which provides core services such as low-level data types, start-up services,
            network connection, and access.

            Unlike Android OS, Apple iOS is more immune against malware owing to its closed-source
            platform and the restricted procedures that Apple follows in apps marketing.
            Android has become the most susceptible OS to malware because of its open-source platform,
            the readiness of Android devices to download and install applications from untrusted/unsecured stores.

            <b> Symbian Operating System </b>
            Symbian OS is an open-source mobile OS written in C++ programming language developed by Symbian Ltd.
            in 1977; it is mostly used by Nokia phones. Symbian OS consists of multiple layers such as OS libraries,
            application engines, MKV, servers, Base-kernel, and hardware interface layer. Symbian was the most prevalent
            mobile device OS until 2010, when it was taken over by Android.

            <b> Windows Phone Operating System </b>
            Windows phone OS is a closed-source code mobile OS developed by Microsoft Corporation
            and used by multiple smart devices (personal digital assistants, smartphones, and touch devices).
            Windows phone OS is based on a compact version of .Net framework, which gives it an advantage in developing.
            Net-oriented mobile applications.
